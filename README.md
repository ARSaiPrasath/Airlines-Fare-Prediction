# Airlines-Fare-Prediction
Developed a Dynamic Flask Web Application which predicts the fares of Airline Tickets in India.
Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the Fare by performing OneHotEncoding and performed HyperParameter tuning with the help of RandomizedSearchCV achieving an accuracy of 81.2%.
Deployed the model on a Flask Server by taking in the Categorical Values as parameters and created UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
